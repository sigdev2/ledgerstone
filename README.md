## About The Project

A small program in C++/Qt for tabular accounting of daily expenses in a double-counting system using a hierarchy of accounts. For storing used a file with SQLite database, which is stored in the application directory. The database is not blocked during operation and therefore is suitable for storage in a cloud like as Dropbox or Google Drive. Each cell uses JavaScript to handle mathematical operations thanks to QScriptEngine.
